demo_ros
========
This package is used as a ROS demonstration. To reproduce the actual package, you can follow these steps :

1) Install ROS (http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation)

2) Follow the tutorials (http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials) to create a ROS workspace and ROS packages

3) To use the Kinect, select the desired drivers from the options given at http://wiki.ros.org/kinect . In this case, I used OpenNi drivers, since the version of freenect available on ROS for the moment is 0.3.2 and the fix for the new kinect model (1473) is version 0.4.0. For more information on how to use OpenNI, refer to http://wiki.ros.org/openni_launch. 

4) If you need to calibrate the Kinect, refer to http://wiki.ros.org/openni_launch/Tutorials
